sort1 uses: bubble
    0.072
    0.042
    0.070
How do you know?: When I ran sort1 on random5000, the result was 0.072s real. Similarly on reversed5000, it was 0.070 and in sorted it was 0.042. So, based upon these observations, I concluded that this program uses bubble sort.

sort2 uses: merge
    0.047
    0.044
    0.048
How do you know?: When I ran sort2 on random5000, the result was 0.047s real. Similarly on reversed5000, it was 0.048 and in sorted it was 0.044. So, based upon these observations, I concluded that this program uses merge sort.
