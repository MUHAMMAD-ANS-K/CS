sort1 uses: bubble
How do you know?: When I ran sort1 on random5000, the result was 0.072s real. Similarly on reversed5000, it was 0.070 and in sorted it was 0.042. So, based upon these observations, I concluded that this program uses bubble sort.

sort2 uses: merge
How do you know?: When I ran sort2 on random5000, the result was 0.047s real. Similarly on reversed5000, it was 0.048 and in sorted it was 0.044. So, based upon these observations, I concluded that this program uses merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection
How do you know?:  When I ran sort3 on random5000, the result was 0.070s real. Similarly on reversed5000, it was 0.072 and in sorted it was 0.068. So, based upon these observations, I concluded that this program uses selection sort.
