Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
As the number of predictions increased, Japan and Russia got 0% percent chances of winning and
many other teams 0.5. As it is a soccer game, it also depends on luck and determination

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Well, after 10000 simulations the predictions stabilized. So, 10000 are enough.
